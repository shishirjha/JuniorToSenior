### Introduction

In this video the difference between JS and ECMAscript is explained and why they are named so. The fact is ES is the specification or set of rules which defines how a programming language should behave. While JS is a language which conforms to ES specification. Earlier the new batch of changes would come in years upto ES6(also ES2015). But after that the changes have been made and announced yearly. So, names are identified by years(ES2016,ES2017,ES2018etc.) ES6 is ES2015 to remove confusion.
